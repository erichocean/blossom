Blossom - A Modern Business Application Framework
=================================================

**NEW!** Blossom 1.0 was released on May 28, 2012.  Here's the release notes:

> Blossom is a business application framework written in JavaScript and 
targeting tablet, mobile, and desktop browsers. It is based on Apple's 
SproutCore application framework. 

> Blossom is primarily being used as the basis for re-usable, model-driven 
business application shells across desktop, tablet and mobile browsers.  As 
such, there is no public documentation or support for Blossom itself, and 
none will be forthcoming.  Blossom is not an end-user product.

> Blossom only includes a very minimal set of built-in widgets, but makes 
developing new widgets **extremely** easy. Because Blossom is meant to be used 
in the context of specific, re-usable application shells, the widgets are 
expected to be custom-built for these shells.

About Blossom
-------------

Designed specifically for tablets and mobile browsers, Blossom extends the 
reach of traditional SproutCore applications to these resource-constrained
environments by re-architecting the view layer to be HTML and CSS-independent.

Blossom is especially well-suited to data-driven, business-type applications.

Blossom also extends the kinds of apps that can be written in JavaScript by 
implementing an easy-to-use, high-performance animation subsystem that 
leverages hardware acceleration on the GPU whenever possible. The API is 
roughly based on Apple's Core Animation framework, and provides similar 
capabilities in modern web browsers.

Blossom's developer tools run on Node.js with an MIT license, and Blossom 
itself is licensed under the GPLv3.

If you are interested in using Blossom as the basis for your own business 
application shell, and would like a commercial license, please contact 
Erich Ocean at eocean@fohr.com.
