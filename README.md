About Blossom
-------------

Designed specifically for tablets and mobile browsers, Blossom extends the 
reach of traditional SproutCore applications to these resource-constrained
environments by re-architecting the view layer to be HTML and CSS-independent.

Blossom is especially well-suited to data-driven, business-type applications.

Blossom also extends the kinds of apps that can be written in JavaScript by 
implementing an easy-to-use, high-performance animation subsystem that 
leverages hardware acceleration on the GPU whenever possible. The API is 
roughly based on Apple's Core Animation framework, and provides similar 
capabilities in modern web browsers.

Blossom's developer tools run on Node.js with an MIT license, and Blossom 
itself is licensed under the GPLv3.

If you are interested in using Blossom as the basis for your own business 
application shell, please contact Lauren Ocean at locean@fohr.com.

Blossom was conceived and written by Erich Ocean at Fohr <eocean@fohr.com>,
and is based on the SproutCore version 1.4.5 release.
